      One of the major driving forces behind this is science. It makes you think <br>
      about the <em>wonder of science</em> and how it has proven to be such a boon in <br>

      All the <em>advancements</em> that man has been able to make are with the help of <br>
      science only. However, it wonâ€™t be wrong to say that science is a <br>
      <b><em>two-edged sword</em></b>. It comes with its own set of advantages and <br>
      disadvantages.
